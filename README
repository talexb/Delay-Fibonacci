Delay-Fibonacci

This module implements a Fibonacci backoff delay that I needed to solve a
client problem. Rather than fail when a network resource was temporarily
unavailable, I plan to use this module to pause after a failure, and then
retry.  Instead of coding that logic into the script, I decided this
functionality needed to go into a module.
